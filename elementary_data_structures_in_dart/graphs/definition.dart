/* Graphs :-
----------
- A graph is a data structure that captures relationships between objects. It’s made up of vertices connected by edges.

Types of Graphs :-
----------------
  1- Weighted Graphs :- In a weighted graph, every edge has a weight associated with it that represents the cost of using this edge. These weights let you choose the cheapest or shortest path between two vertices.
  2- Directed Graphs :- As well as assigning a weight to an edge, your graphs can also have direction. Directed graphs are more restrictive to traverse because an edge may only permit
                        traversal in one direction. The diagram below represents a directed graph.
  3- Undirected Graphs :- 
                      • Two connected vertices have edges going back and forth.
                      • The weight of an edge applies to both directions.
