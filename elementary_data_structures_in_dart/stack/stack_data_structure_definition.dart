1- There are only two essential operations for a stack:
-------------------------------------------------------
• push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
• pop: Remove the top element of the stack.
• push and pop are both constant-time operations.

2-Stacks are used prominently in all disciplines of programming. To list a couple:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Memory allocation uses stacks at the architectural level. Memory for local
  variables is also managed using a stack.
• Programming languages that support recursion manage the function calls with a
  stack. If you accidentally write an infinite recursion, you’ll get a stack overflow.
  Perhaps you’ve heard of a website that goes by that name. :]
• Search and conquer algorithms, such as finding a path out of a maze, use stacks to
  facilitate backtracking.
