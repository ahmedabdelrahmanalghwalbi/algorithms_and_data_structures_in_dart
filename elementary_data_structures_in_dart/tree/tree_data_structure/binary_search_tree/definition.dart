/* Binary Search Tree :-
----------------------
- A binary search tree, or BST, is a data structure that facilitates fast lookup, insert
  and removal operations. Consider the following decision tree where picking a side
  forfeits all the possibilities of the other side, cutting the problem in half.

• The value of a left child must be less than the value of its parent.
• Consequently, the value of a right child must be greater than or equal to the value of its parent.
