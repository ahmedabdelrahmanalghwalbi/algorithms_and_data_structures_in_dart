/* Tree
-------
- The tree is a data structure of profound importance. It’s used to tackle many recurring challenges in software development, such as:
    • Representing hierarchical relationships.
    • Managing sorted data.
    • Facilitating fast lookup operations.
- trees are made up of nodes,Each node can carry some data and keeps track of its children.
- Trees are viewed starting from the top and branching towards the bottom, just like a real tree.
- Every node except for the topmost one is connected to exactly one node above it.
  That node is called a parent node. The nodes connected directly below a parent are
  called child nodes. In a tree, every child has exactly one parent.
- Root :- The topmost node in the tree is called the root of the tree. It is the only node that has no parent.
- Leaf :- A nodee is a Leaf if has no children.

/* Traversal Algorithms (Iterating through trees)(خوارزميات الاجتياز)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Iterating through linear collections such as lists or linked lists is straightforward.
- traversal algorithms are used to visit all the nodes in a tree or graph in a specific order. There are several traversal algorithms,
  each with its own characteristics and use cases. The most common traversal algorithms are Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

1- depth-first traversal (DFS):- 
   - a technique that starts at the root and visits nodes as deep as it can before backtracking.
