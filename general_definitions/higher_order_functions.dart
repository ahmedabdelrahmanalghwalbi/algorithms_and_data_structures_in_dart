/* Higher-Order Functions (HOFs) :-

- A function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function is a higher-order function.
  It is possible because functions are treated as first-class citizens in Dart.
  
- Youâ€™ve already used higher-order functions if you have used any built-in array methods like where, map, or reduce.
